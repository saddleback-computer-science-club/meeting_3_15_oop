Extend the Course class you just wrote with a class to hold a transferable course. That is write a class to represent a transferable course, which inherits functionality from the generic course class you've already written.

The new class should have:
1. A string data member to describe the requirements for transfer eligilbility
   (e.g. "Must be passed with a C or higher").
2. Accessor and mutator for the new data member.
2. A default constructor which takes no arguments.
3. A constructor which takes all data members as input (those from the Course class and
   the new ones from the TransferableCourse class).
4. An overloaded print method which calls the parent's print(), then adds child-specific
   details.
