Design a class to hold information about a college course. It should have:
1. Private members to hold a title and a number of credit units
2. An accessor and a mutator for each of these data members
3. A default constructor that takes no parameters
4. An overloaded constructor that takes both data members as parameters
5. A function to print the course's information


Course

- title : string
- credits : int

+ Course();
+ Course(string, string, int)
+ print() const : void

+ getTitle() const : string
+ getNumCredits() const : int
+ setTitle(string) : void
+ setNumCredits(int) : void
